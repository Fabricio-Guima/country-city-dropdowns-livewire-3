Country-City Dropdowns with Livewire 3

This project is a simple Laravel 12 application that demonstrates how to build dependent dropdowns (Country â†’ City) using Livewire 3.
When a user selects a country, the cities dropdown is automatically updated with all the cities belonging to that country.

The project includes two main routes:

/companies/create â€“ Create a new company.

/companies/{companyId}/edit â€“ Edit an existing company.

It uses:

Livewire 3 (full-page components, hooks like mount and updated, form validations, layouts).

Docker for PHP 8.4 and Laravel setup.

Example of form handling with validation and relational dropdowns.
